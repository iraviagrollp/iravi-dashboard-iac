# IRAVI AGRO LIFE LLP — Admin Dashboard

## Instructions for Claude

- After every conversation where decisions are made, code is written, or plans change — update this file to reflect the current state.
- Keep the **What Is Built** checklist accurate: tick items as they are completed.
- Keep the **What Is Next** section current: remove completed items, add newly discovered tasks.
- If a technical decision changes (schema, infra, architecture), update the relevant section here immediately.
- This file is the single source of truth for project state across sessions — treat it as such.
- **After every code change** — no matter how small — update both this file and `README.md` before closing the task:
  - CLAUDE.md: reflect any architectural decisions, new resources, security rules, or design constraints introduced by the change
  - README.md: update "What This Provisions", expected resource counts, troubleshooting entries, or deployment steps affected by the change
  - Never consider a task complete until both files are consistent with the current state of the code
- **Cross-project sync rule:** This file tracks high-level completion of ALL components (IaC, FileSyncAgent, ETL Lambda, API, UI). Each component has its own CLAUDE.md with detailed status. When a component reaches a milestone, tick the checkbox here. Do NOT duplicate implementation detail — just reflect done/in-progress/not-started.
  - FileSyncAgent detail → `D:\Projects\Iravi\FileSyncAgent\CLAUDE.md`

## Architecture

```
FUSIL PRO (External)
    ↓ exports 8 Excel files to local server folder nightly
Local Export Folder (FUSIL PRO server)
    ↓ File Sync Agent (Python + Windows Task Scheduler)
S3 Landing Zone  s3://iravi-dashboard-tfstate-<acct>/
    raw/{date}/*.xlsx + manifest.json
    processed/{date}/  ← archived after ETL
    ↓ S3 event on manifest.json  |  EventBridge fallback 9PM IST
Data Extractor & Massager (AWS Lambda)
    ↓ upserts processed data
Dashboard DB (RDS PostgreSQL 16 — db.t3.small — ap-south-1)
    ↓ on ETL success
Redis Updater (AWS Lambda)
    ↓ 7-day TTL
ElastiCache Redis
    ↑ cache-aside (miss → Dashboard DB → populate Redis)
API Layer (API Gateway + Lambda + Cognito JWT)
    ↑
Dashboard UI (React + AWS Amplify)
    ↑
Users (Admin / Finance / Operations / Viewer)
```

**Two flows:**
- **Redis Enricher Flow (A→B→C→D):** nightly batch pipeline
- **Dashboard Flow (1→2→3):** on-demand UI requests

---

## Source Files (from FUSIL PRO)

FUSIL PRO exports **8 Excel files** to a local server folder each evening.
The File Sync Agent watches the folder and uploads to S3 once all 8 are present,
then generates `manifest.json` as the final step (pipeline trigger).

### File naming pattern
| File | Pattern |
|---|---|
| Sale | `RGF Sales Book{DD-M-YYYY}({H.MM.SS}).xlsx` |
| Sale Returns | `RGF Sales Return Book{DD-M-YYYY}({H.MM.SS}).xlsx` |
| Purchase | `RGF Purchase Book{DD-M-YYYY}({H.MM.SS}).xlsx` |
| Purchase Returns | `RGF Purchase Return Report{DD-M-YYYY}({H.MM.SS}).xlsx` |
| Expenses | `RGF Expenses*{DD-M-YYYY}({H.MM.SS}).xlsx` (file not yet seen — assumed similar) |
| Stocks | `Stocks.xlsx` (no date in filename) |
| Customer Accounts | `Customer Accounts Export File{DD-M-YYYY}({H.MM.SS}).xlsx` |
| Customer Balances | `Customer Balances{DD-M-YYYY}({H.MM.SS}).xlsx` |

### Excel structure — all transaction files
```
Row 1: Company name (IRAVI AGRO LIFE LLP)
Row 2: Empty
Row 3: Report title
Row 4: Date range (From Date / To Date)
Row 5: Column headers   ← actual field names start here
Row 6+: Data rows
Last row(s): Totals / footer — first column is None, 'Total', or 'Date :'
```
**ETL must skip rows 1–5 and detect/skip total rows.**

### Column schemas (from actual file inspection)

**Sale** — invoice-level:
`Date, Voucher No, Branch, Party, Party GSTN, Qty, Gross, Disc, AV, CGST, SGST, IGST, Net, BillValue`

**Sale Returns** — invoice-level:
`Date, Voucher No, Branch, Location, Storage Bin, Party, Party GSTN, Ref BillNo, Ref BillDate, Qty, Gross, Disc, MRP Amount, GMD, AV, CGST, SGST, IGST, Net, Charges, ChrCGST, ChrSGST, ChrIGST, Deductions, Adjustments, Roundoff, BillValue, Remarks`

**Purchase** — invoice-level:
`Date, Voucher No, Branch, Party, Party GSTN, Ref BillDate, Qty, Gross, CGST, SGST, IGST, Net, Charges, ChrCGST, ChrSGST, ChrIGST, Roundoff, BillValue`

**Purchase Returns** — **line-item level** (one row per product per return voucher):
`Date, Voucher No, Branch, Party, Ref BillDate, Product, Qty, Rate, Gross, Disc Rate, Disc, MRP, GMD, AV, CGST Rate, CGST, SGST Rate, SGST, IGST Rate, IGST, Net, Barcodes, Narration`

**Stocks** — snapshot, two useful sheets:
- Sheet `Stocks`: `S No, PRODUCT, PACKING, AP(current), TS(current), AP(prev), TS(prev), Qty(current), Qty(prev), Rate, Opening, Closing`
  - Date of snapshot is in the **footer row** (`'Date :'` in first column)
  - Product name spans multiple packing rows — ETL must **forward-fill** `product_brand_name` and `s_no`
  - Blank separator rows between product groups — skip rows where all values are None
- Sheet `Margin 03-04`: `S No, PRODUCT, PACKING, COST PRICE, %, % of Margin, NRV PRICE, NRV`

**Customer Accounts** — master data, **no header rows** (Row 1 = column names directly):
`Name, ParentId, Code, Description, GST, GSTRegType, City, State, PIN, MobileNo, AltMobileNo, Email, PAN, LicenceNo, ...`

**Customer Balances** — snapshot, standard 5-row header:
`Branch, Party, Code, City, Debit, Credit, Balance, Balance In CC`
- Balance is a string like `"396324.00 Dr"` or `"86793.00 Cr"` — must be parsed to numeric + type
- `Dr` = customer owes (receivable), `Cr` = business owes customer
- Date comes from Row 4 `As At Date` field

## Database Schema (FINALIZED)

File: `IaC/db/schema.sql`
Target: Amazon RDS PostgreSQL 16 — database name `iravi_dashboard`

### Tables

| Table | Type | Upsert Key |
|---|---|---|
| `dim_customers` | Dimension | `customer_name` |
| `dim_packings` | Dimension | `packing_description` |
| `customer_details` | Dimension | `customer_name` |
| `fact_sales` | Fact (daily append) | `(voucher_no, transaction_date)` |
| `fact_sales_returns` | Fact (daily append) | `(voucher_no, transaction_date)` |
| `fact_purchases` | Fact (daily append) | `(voucher_no, transaction_date)` |
| `fact_purchase_returns` | Fact (daily append) | `(voucher_no, transaction_date, product_name)` |
| `fact_expenses` | Fact (daily append) | `(voucher_no, transaction_date)` |
| `snapshot_stock` | Snapshot (uni-temporal milestoned) | natural key `(brand, technical, packing_size, packing_configuration, branch, special_packing_mention, entry_date)` + `in_z`; `out_z IS NULL` = current |
| `snapshot_stock_margin` | Snapshot (replace per date) | `(snapshot_date, product_brand_name, packing_id)` |
| `snapshot_customer_balances` | Snapshot (replace per date) | `(snapshot_date, branch, customer_name)` |
| `customer_ledger` | Snapshot (uni-temporal milestoned) | natural key `(transaction_date, voucher_no, account_name, category, sub_category)`; `out_z IS NULL` = current |
| `appendix_b_x11_stock` | Snapshot (uni-temporal milestoned) | natural key `(barcode, technical_name, vendor)`; `out_z IS NULL` = current |
| `appendix_b_x11_stock_ledger` | Snapshot (uni-temporal milestoned) | natural key `(purchase_date, iravi_voucher, technical_name, barcode)`; `out_z IS NULL` = current |
| `purchases` | Snapshot (uni-temporal milestoned) | PK `(purchase_date, voucher_no, branch, party, product)`; `out_z IS NULL` = current; `purchase_return` = 'N' (AppendixPurchaseReport) or 'Y' (AppendixPurReturn) |
| `sales` | Snapshot (uni-temporal milestoned) | PK `(purchase_date, voucher_no, branch, party, product)`; `out_z IS NULL` = current; `sales_return` = 'N' (AppendixSale) or 'Y' (AppendixRetSales) |
| `etl_runs` | Audit | `run_date` |
| `app_roles` | RBAC | `role_name` |
| `app_screens` | RBAC (seeded) | `screen_key` |
| `app_role_screens` | RBAC map | `(role_id, screen_key)` |
| `app_users` | RBAC | `username` |

### Migrations convention
One-off DML repairs and data fixes live in `db/migrations/` as numbered SQL files (`001_...`, `002_...`). They are not run automatically — apply manually via psql through the SSM tunnel. Always commit the migration file alongside the code change that made it necessary so the git history explains why it was run.

### Key schema decisions
- `source_date` was **removed** — lineage tracked via `ingested_at` + `etl_runs.files_processed`
- `dim_packings` normalises packing strings — now only used by `snapshot_stock_margin`; `snapshot_stock` dropped its `packing_id` FK (packing stored as `packing_size` + `packing_configuration` directly, matching process.py output)
- `snapshot_stock` uses **uni-temporal milestoning** (`in_z`/`out_z`): on re-run for the same `entry_date`, the old row is closed (`out_z = NOW()`) and a fresh row inserted (`in_z = NOW(), out_z = NULL`). A partial unique index on `WHERE out_z IS NULL` enforces exactly one active record per natural key. Superseded rows are retained for audit.
- `dim_customers` has no `address1/2/3` — only `city`, `state`, `pin` retained
- `fact_sales_returns` has no `party_group`, `party_address`, `party_mobile` — joinable from `dim_customers`
- `snapshot_customer_balances.balance_amount` is always positive numeric; direction in `balance_type` (`'Dr'`/`'Cr'`)
- `fact_expenses` schema is **provisional** — modelled after Purchase Book, will need adjustment when the Expenses file is seen (likely needs a `category` column)

## AWS Infrastructure (FINALIZED — Terraform written)

**Region:** `ap-south-1` (Mumbai)

### Security groups

| SG | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sg_lambda_id` | Attached to all Lambda functions |
| `sg_rds_id` | RDS — inbound from Lambda SG + bastion SG |
| `sg_elasticache_id` | ElastiCache — inbound from Lambda SG + bastion SG |
| `sg_vpc_endpoints` | VPC Interface endpoint ENIs — inbound 443 from Lambda SG only |
| `sg_bastion` | Bastion EC2 — outbound 443 (SSM) + outbound 5432 to RDS + outbound 6379 to ElastiCache. No inbound rules. |

**Important:** Always use `sg_vpc_endpoints` (not `sg_lambda_id`) as the `security_group_ids` for any Interface VPC endpoint. Interface endpoint ENIs need an inbound rule; `sg_lambda_id` has none.

### Bastion host (RDS access via SSM Session Manager)
- Instance: `t3.micro`, Amazon Linux 2023, public subnet, `~$8/mo`
- No SSH port, no key pair, no IP allowlist — access via AWS SSM Session Manager
- IAM instance profile with `AmazonSSMManagedInstanceCore` attached to the instance
- Connect using SSM port forwarding — see README for step-by-step
- `terraform output bastion_instance_id` gives the instance ID needed for the SSM command

### GitHub Actions secrets (pipeline variables)

| Secret | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `AWS_ROLE_ARN` | OIDC: pipeline assumes `terraform-deployer` IAM role to authenticate with AWS |
| `TF_VAR_alert_email` | Terraform `alert_email` variable — SNS CloudWatch alarm email |
| `TF_VAR_dashboard_username` | Terraform `dashboard_username` variable — injected into Amplify as `VITE_DASHBOARD_USERNAME` |
| `TF_VAR_dashboard_password` | Terraform `dashboard_password` variable — injected into Amplify as `VITE_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` |

`terraform.tfvars` is git-ignored. The pipeline reads these secrets as `TF_VAR_*` env vars instead — Terraform maps them automatically to the matching input variables.

### Pipeline dependency: business-core checkout required in ALL jobs
All three pipeline jobs (validate, plan, apply) must checkout `business-core` and create the symlink at `$GITHUB_WORKSPACE/../business-core`. Reason: Terraform's `filemd5()` and `archive_file` data sources reference Lambda source files in `business-core` and are evaluated at `terraform validate` time — not just at plan/apply. If business-core is missing, the validate job fails even though it doesn't need AWS credentials.

### S3 notification filter prefixes — avoid spaces
S3 notification filter prefixes containing spaces (e.g. `raw/Current Stock Balances`) silently fail to match even when the object key is correct. Use a prefix that stops before the first space (`raw/Current` instead of `raw/Current Stock Balances`). The Lambda handler must URL-decode the S3 event key with `unquote_plus()` because S3 delivers keys URL-encoded (`Current+Stock+Balances...` with `%28`/`%29` for parentheses) — the raw key from `record['s3']['object']['key']` cannot be used directly for filename comparisons or boto3 S3 calls.

### Lambda layer build pattern
Do NOT use `null_resource` + `local-exec` provisioner to run pip install inside Terraform. `data "archive_file"` does not reliably wait for provisioner output even with `depends_on`, causing "missing directory" errors on first apply. Instead: run pip install as an explicit GitHub Actions workflow step before `terraform init` in the plan and apply jobs. Each Lambda with a dependency layer gets its own named CI step. Current layers:
- `etl_stocks` → `.lambda_layers/etl_stocks/python/`
- `api_deps` → `.lambda_layers/api_deps/python/` — **shared** between `api` and `redis_updater` Lambdas
- `etl_customer_ledger` → `.lambda_layers/etl_customer_ledger/python/`

The step creates the directory with Linux-compatible wheels; Terraform's `archive_file` zips it normally. When adding a new Lambda with a layer, add the corresponding pip install step to both plan and apply jobs in `.github/workflows/terraform.yml`.

### Amplify — one-time import required
`amplify.tf` manages environment variables on an Amplify app that was **connected to GitHub manually** via the Amplify console. Before the first `terraform apply` on a fresh state, import the existing app into Terraform state:
```bash
terraform import aws_amplify_app.dashboard <AMPLIFY_APP_ID>
```
Find the App ID in the Amplify console URL (e.g. `d1a2b3c4e5f6g7`). Without this import, `terraform apply` will attempt to create a duplicate Amplify app.

### Terraform outputs needed downstream
After `terraform apply`, capture these — they are inputs to every Lambda built next:
```
sg_lambda_id        ← attach to ALL Lambda functions
private_subnet_ids  ← attach ALL Lambda functions and ElastiCache
db_secret_arn       ← Lambda IAM policies (GetSecretValue)
sns_alerts_arn      ← ETL failure notifications
sg_elasticache_id   ← ElastiCache cluster (not yet provisioned)
```

### DB credentials
Stored in Secrets Manager at path `iravi/dashboard/db`:
```json
{ "host": "...", "port": 5432, "dbname": "iravi_dashboard", "username": "dashboard_admin", "password": "..." }
```
Lambda connection pattern: open connection outside the handler, cache for execution environment lifetime.

---

## ETL Logic Decisions

### Trigger chain
1. FUSIL PRO drops files to local folder
2. File Sync Agent (runs every 15 min from 7PM IST) detects all 8 files, uploads to `s3://.../raw/{date}/`, generates `manifest.json` last
3. S3 `ObjectCreated` event on `manifest.json` triggers ETL Lambda
4. EventBridge cron at 9PM IST is a safety fallback
5. CloudWatch alarm fires if no successful ETL run detected by 9:30PM IST

### ETL idempotency
All fact table writes use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` (or `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE`) on the unique constraint. Re-running the same file produces no duplicates.

### Data strategies
| Data type | Strategy |
|---|---|
| Sales, Purchases, Expenses, Returns | Daily incremental append |
| Stock snapshot | Full replace per `snapshot_date` |
| Customer balances | Full replace per `snapshot_date` |
| Customer accounts | Upsert on `customer_name` |

### Historical migration
- Transaction files: **1 month** back from go-live (one-time manual ETL run)
- Stock report: **no history** — starts from go-live day (snapshot only, no historical data available)
- Customer accounts: current export only

### ETL audit
Every run writes a row to `etl_runs`: `run_date`, `started_at`, `completed_at`, `status` (`running`/`success`/`failed`), `files_processed` (JSONB list of filenames), `error_message`.

---

## Alerting Matrix

| Alert | Condition | Raised by |
|---|---|---|
| Files not exported | No files in local folder by 7:45PM IST | File Sync Agent |
| S3 upload failed | Upload error after 3 retries | File Sync Agent |
| ETL not triggered | No manifest in `raw/{today}/` by 9:30PM IST | CloudWatch |
| ETL failed | Lambda exits with error | CloudWatch → SNS |
| Redis update failed | Redis Updater Lambda error | CloudWatch → SNS |

---

## RBAC Roles (AWS Cognito)

| Role | Access |
|---|---|
| Admin | All views + user management + ETL run history |
| Finance | All views including Finance Overview (P&L) |
| Operations | Sales, Purchases, Inventory, Expenses, Customer list (no balances) |
| Viewer | Executive Summary only — read-only |

---

## Dashboard Views (to be built)

1. **Executive Summary** — KPI cards: sales, gross margin, net cash, outstanding receivables, stock value
2. **Sales Analytics** — trends, net sales (gross − returns), by branch, top customers
3. **Expense Tracker** — by category, trend, vs revenue ratio
4. **Purchases & Inventory** — net purchases, stock levels by product/packing, AP vs TS split, margin view
5. **Customer Management** — balances, AR aging (0-30 / 31-60 / 61-90 / 90+ days)
6. **Finance Overview** — P&L summary, MoM comparison, cash flow (Finance role only)

- [x] AWS account setup guide (`design/aws-account-setup-guide.html`)
- [x] AWS Account + OIDC setup — account live, `terraform-deployer` role created, pipeline stages 2 & 3 enabled, `terraform apply` run, all infra provisioned
- [x] File Sync Agent — deployed and running on FUSIL PRO server · `D:\Projects\Iravi\FileSyncAgent\`
- [x] business-core project created — `D:\Projects\Iravi\business-core\` with lambda scaffolds for etl_sales, redis_updater, api

- [x] Terraform — `outputs.tf` updated — added `elasticache_host` output
- [x] business-core — `etl_stocks/handler.py` — emits `ETLStocksSuccess` EventBridge event after successful DB upsert
- [x] business-core — `redis_updater/handler.py` — fully implemented: handles `ETLStocksSuccess` (stocks cache) and `ETLSalesSuccess` (stub); writes `iravi:stocks:summary` + `iravi:stocks:current` to Redis with 24h TTL
- [x] business-core — `api/handler.py` — fully implemented: `GET /stocks/summary` and `GET /stocks/current` with cache-aside (Redis → RDS fallback); `GET /sales` stub
- [x] Dashboard UI — `D:\Projects\Iravi\ui\` — Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind; sidebar nav (Sales, Purchases, Stocks, Customers, Reports); Current Stocks page with 4 stat tiles + filterable/sortable table; deployed via AWS Amplify Hosting
- [x] DB migrations folder — `db/migrations/` established; `001_repair_snapshot_stock_duplicates.sql` closes pre-index duplicate `out_z IS NULL` rows (applied 2026-06-03)
- [x] DB migrations — `002_repair_customer_ledger_duplicates.sql` — defensive duplicate-close script for `customer_ledger` (not yet applied; run if ETL ever inserts without milestoning)
- [x] DB migrations — `003_add_voucher_no_to_customer_ledger.sql` — adds `voucher_no VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL` column and rebuilds `uix_customer_ledger_active` to include it; safe to run (table exists, no data inserted yet)
- [x] DB migrations — `004_create_customer_details.sql` — creates `customer_details` table (upsert on `customer_name`); also added to `schema.sql`
- [x] DB migrations — `005_create_appendix_b_x11_stock.sql` — creates `appendix_b_x11_stock` (Barcodes Masters export); uni-temporal milestoned, natural key `(barcode, technical_name, vendor)`
- [x] DB migrations — `006_create_appendix_b_x11_stock_ledger.sql` — creates `appendix_b_x11_stock_ledger` (AppendixPurchaseReport export); uni-temporal milestoned, natural key `(purchase_date, iravi_voucher, technical_name, barcode)`
- [x] DB migrations — `007_create_purchases.sql` — creates `purchases` (line-item purchase ledger, AppendixPurchaseReport + AppendixPurReturn); uni-temporal milestoned, PK `(purchase_date, voucher_no, branch, party, product)`
- [x] DB migrations — `008_create_sales.sql` — creates `sales` (line-item sales ledger, AppendixSale + AppendixRetSales); same shape as `purchases` with `sales_return` in place of `purchase_return`; uni-temporal milestoned, PK `(purchase_date, voucher_no, branch, party, product)`
- [x] Terraform — `lambda_etl_customer_ledger.tf` — Customer Ledger ETL Lambda; S3 trigger on prefix `raw/Ledger` (matches `Ledger All Accounts*.xlsx`); upserts `customer_ledger` with uni-temporal milestoning; emits EventBridge event; has own pip layer (built by CI step "Build etl_customer_ledger layer"); `lambda_etl_sales.tf` bucket notification updated to fan out to all 3 ETL Lambdas
- [x] Terraform — `amplify.tf` — manages Amplify app environment variables (`VITE_API_BASE_URL`, `VITE_DASHBOARD_USERNAME`, `VITE_DASHBOARD_PASSWORD`); app was connected to GitHub manually — one-time `terraform import` required before first apply; `amplify_default_domain` added to outputs
- [x] Terraform — `lambda_api.tf` updated — `api_deps` shared layer (psycopg2 + redis-py, linux wheels) used by both api and redis_updater; CORS configured for `dashboard.iraviagrolife.com`
- [x] CI workflow — "Build etl_customer_ledger layer" and "Build api-deps layer" steps added to both plan and apply jobs
- [x] RBAC phase 1 — DB migration `009_create_rbac.sql` (app_roles/app_screens/app_role_screens/app_users); JWT signing key secret `iravi/dashboard/jwt` (`secrets.tf`); API Lambda env `JWT_SECRET_ARN` + `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_*`, IAM for the jwt secret, `/auth/*` + `/admin/*` routes, CORS PUT/DELETE (`lambda_api.tf`); dashboard creds removed from Amplify bundle (`amplify.tf`). Login + `/admin/*` enforced server-side; data endpoints are UI-only gated (full enforcement = backlog)
- [x] Admin cache flush — `POST /admin/cache/flush` route added to `api_rbac_routes` (`lambda_api.tf`); API Lambda handler deletes all `iravi:*` Redis keys (namespace-scoped, not FLUSHDB) so the cache rehydrates from RDS on next request; UI exposes it as an admin-only button left of the dark-mode toggle in the navbar (`iravi-ui` Layout). Requires IaC apply for the route + Lambda redeploy to take effect
- [x] Terraform — `lambda_api.tf` updated — `GET /reports/customer-balances-fy` route added (`aws_apigatewayv2_route.reports_customer_balances_fy`); same per-path explicit route pattern as all other data routes; CORS already covers GET via the existing `cors_configuration` block — no CORS change needed
- [x] DB migrations — `010_add_customer_balances_fy_screen.sql` — idempotently inserts `app_screens` seed row `('reports.customer_balances_fy', 'Customer Balances (FY)', 90)` with `ON CONFLICT (screen_key) DO NOTHING`; RBAC key for the new Customer Balances (FY) report screen; NOT YET APPLIED — apply manually via psql over the SSM tunnel post-merge
- [x] DB migrations — `011_add_customer_code_to_customer_details.sql` — adds `customer_code VARCHAR(20)` (nullable) to `customer_details` plus `idx_customer_details_code` index; sourced from the "General" sheet of the Customer Accounts Export File by `etl_customer_accounts`; NOT YET APPLIED — MUST be applied manually via psql over the SSM tunnel BEFORE the updated `etl_customer_accounts` Lambda runs

**Stocks pipeline is complete end-to-end.** Current Stocks UI is built and ready to deploy. Redis cache is populated nightly by redis_updater after `ETLStocksSuccess` event.

**Redis key schema (stocks):**
- `iravi:stocks:summary` — `{total_kgs, total_vols, stock_valuation, total_products, as_of, updated_at}`, 24h TTL
- `iravi:stocks:current` — JSON array of all active `snapshot_stock` rows, 24h TTL
- Unit classification for tiles: packing_size scanned for `KG|GMS|GM` (weight) vs `LTR|LT|ML|L` (volume) using Python regex

**UI stack decision:** Vite + React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS. No shadcn/ui dependency — components written in plain Tailwind. Client-side filtering/sorting on the ~500-row dataset (no extra API calls needed).

## What Is Next (build in this order)

- [ ] **Deploy Terraform** — apply `elasticache.tf` + updated Lambda configs via GitHub Actions; capture `elasticache_host` output
- [ ] **Deploy UI** — connect `D:\Projects\Iravi\ui\` to AWS Amplify Hosting; set `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in Amplify console to value of `terraform output api_endpoint`
- [ ] **Test stocks flow end-to-end** — upload real `Current Stock Balances*.xlsx` to `raw/` in S3, verify `snapshot_stock` rows in RDS, verify Redis keys populate, verify UI tiles + table render correctly

- [ ] **Implement etl_sales handler** — parse `RGF Sales Book*.xlsx` (skip rows 1–5, detect total rows); upsert `dim_customers` + `fact_sales`; emit `ETLSalesSuccess`; move file to `processed/`
- [ ] **Implement etl_customer_ledger handler** — scaffold `business-core/lambda/etl_customer_ledger/handler.py`; parse `Ledger All Accounts*.xlsx`; skip "Brought Forward" rows; two-step milestoning upsert into `customer_ledger`; emit `ETLCustomerLedgerSuccess`; move file to `processed/` (CI layer build step already exists)
- [ ] **Implement `_update_sales_cache()`** in redis_updater once etl_sales is verified

- [ ] **Cognito** — add Terraform; JWT authoriser on API Gateway; Amplify Authenticator in UI

- [ ] **One-time historical migration** — 1 month of transaction files through ETL Lambda; stock history starts from go-live

## Key Technical Choices

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Language (Lambdas) | Python 3.12 | Faster to write ETL/data code, openpyxl for Excel parsing |
| DB driver | psycopg2 | Standard PostgreSQL driver for Python |
| Excel parsing | openpyxl | Handles .xlsx, reads cell values cleanly |
| Redis client | redis-py | Standard Python Redis client |
| IaC | Terraform | Reproducible, version-controlled |
| Auth | AWS Cognito | Native AWS, integrates with API Gateway |
| Frontend | React + Amplify | Good charting ecosystem, Amplify handles CI/CD + hosting |
| AWS region | ap-south-1 | Closest to business location |
| RDS Multi-AZ | No (for now) | Dashboard is not mission-critical — add later |
| RDS Proxy | No (for now) | Low concurrency — add if connection exhaustion becomes an issue |

## Current Cost Estimate (ap-south-1)

| Resource | Monthly |
|---|---|
| RDS db.t3.small | ~$29 |
| NAT Gateway | ~$44 |
| Secrets Manager endpoint | ~$10 |
| Bastion EC2 t3.micro (24/7) | ~$10 |
| CloudWatch + S3 | ~$3 |
| **Total** | **~$95/mo** (~$89 if bastion stopped when idle) |

## Prospective Cost Saving Avenues

Items confirmed as not worth doing now but worth revisiting as traffic and costs grow.
Do not act on these without explicit discussion — they are parked here for reference.

| # | Change | Estimated Saving | When to do it | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **VPC endpoints for CloudWatch Logs + SNS** | ~$5–10/mo | When ETL log volume grows or NAT costs spike | Lambda logs and SNS publishes currently route through NAT Gateway. Two interface endpoints (~$16/mo combined) would eliminate that traffic. Pays for itself once log volume is meaningful. |
| 2 | **RDS Reserved Instance (1-year, no upfront)** | ~$8–9/mo | After 3–6 months of stable usage — confirm instance size is right first | 30% discount on the DB compute cost. No code or infrastructure change — purchase via AWS console. Pointless to reserve before knowing if `t3.small` is the right size. |
| 3 | **Lambda Graviton (arm64 runtime)** | ~10–20% on Lambda compute | After all Lambda functions are created and stable | One-line Terraform change per function: `architectures = ["arm64"]`. Python 3.12 supports arm64 natively. Do this as a batch change across all Lambdas once ETL, Redis Updater, and API functions exist. |

## Data Freshness Contract

Dashboard shows data **as of the previous evening's export (~8PM IST)**.
A user viewing at 7AM sees data current to the prior day.
This expectation has been set with stakeholders.

Stock trend data is only available from go-live date — no historical stock snapshots exist.
